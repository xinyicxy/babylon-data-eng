# **Hospital Data Management Scripts**

This project consists of Python scripts to manage and populate a PostgreSQL database with the HHS dataset and Quality dataset. The database consists of three tables:
	1.	demo: Stores hospital demographic information.
	2.	weekly: Tracks weekly hospital bed usage statistics.
	3.	quality: Captures hospital quality scores.

The scripts handle table creation and data insertion from structured CSV files, ensuring data consistency and proper relationships between the tables.
